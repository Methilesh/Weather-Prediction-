## Introduction
Weather prediction is a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of atmospheric systems. Traditional methods often rely on meteorological principles and historical data analysis. However, machine learning offers a data-driven approach that can potentially improve the accuracy of weather forecasting.

In this project, we employ various machine learning algorithms to predict weather conditions based on features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
## Preprocessing
Before training the models, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling
- Encoding categorical variables (if any)
- Feature selection (if necessary)
- Splitting into training and testing sets

## Model Training
We experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms such as:
- Random Forest
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize the models for better performance.
## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on various metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Comparative analysis of different models helps identify the most suitable approach for weather prediction.
## result
Random Forest Model: 99.52 %
